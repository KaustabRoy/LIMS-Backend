# Laboratory Information Management System (Backend)

## Overview
This is a backend for the project Laboratory Information Management System, developed using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) for developing robust APIs. The backend uses powerful MySQL server for database and has a Role Based user authentication. I have implemented Class-Based Views to make the API functionalities more structured and cleaner in code level and designed to provide with distinct endpoints for each functionality.

## Key Features
- MySQL Database Integration - uses MySQL database for secure storage and faster transactions.
- Role Based User Authentication - authentication is done based on user roles and contents are served accordingly, ensuring secure access.
- API Endpoints - Provides distinct API enpoints for handling each functionality efficiently.
- Class Based Views (CBVs) - CVBs make the codebase more structured, cleaner and improve code readability.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.6
- Django 4.2.5
- Django REST Framework 3.14.0
- Django Cors Headers 4.3.1
- MySQLClient 2.2.1
