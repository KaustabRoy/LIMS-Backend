# Laboratory Information Management System

## Overview
This is a backend for the project Laboratory Information Management System, implementing Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) for creating APIs. The backend uses MySQL server for database and has a Role Based user authentication. I have implemented Class-Based Views to make the API functionalities more structured and cleaner in code level. The backend is designed to efficiently provide with distinct endpoints for each functionality.
